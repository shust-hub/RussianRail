              <p>Given the vastness of Russia&rsquo;s territory, train journeys are commonly measured in days, rather than in miles or kilometres. But what better way to truly experience the diversity of the Russian landscape? Travelling by train is so much more atmospheric and exciting than by plane. Instead of jumping from one place to another with no sense of your surroundings, you see the forests of Siberia pass by, experience the vastness of the steppe, observe one city melt away and another gradually appear, all from the comfort of your seat. Most long-distance train journeys begin or end in Moscow, so if you&rsquo;re looking to start your adventure, that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll want to be. Train stations typically take the name of their final stop &ndash; so the &lsquo;Moskovskii&rsquo; station in St Petersburg serves routes to Moscow, and from Moscow&lsquo;s &lsquo;Kazanskii&rsquo; station you can hop on a train to Kazan.<br /><strong></strong></p>

<h2>What are the different options for train travel in Russia?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Train types according to service provided:</strong> Branded trains, provide a modern and efficient service with many amenities. Non-branded trains are a simpler, but also reliable and popular form of travel.</li>
<li><strong>Train types by speed:</strong> High-speed train travel between Russia&rsquo;s two capitals is perfect for business travellers. Express trains comprise the majority of Russia&rsquo;s long-distance routes, and regular trains are best for those on a relaxed time schedule who want to enjoy the view.</li>
<li><strong>Train types by distance covered:</strong> Long-distance services cover 200km or more, and journeys are even measured in days! Suburban trains are much-loved by Russians, reasonably priced, and give travellers an authentic view of Russian life.</li>
<li><strong>Types of compartments:</strong> VIP carriages boast a range of luxury amenities such as TVs, showers and even bars. First-class cabins are more common, and best for those who like their privacy. Second-class kupe are lockable compartments ideal for groups of friends or families, and third-class platzkart is ideal for those on a budget who want to meet local people.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Train types according to service provided</h2>
<h3>Branded trains (фирменный)</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.travexpress.net/pages/013711.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="900" height="550" caption="false" alt="Train Types in Russia - Branded trains" /></p>
<p>Special (firmenny) trains are branded Russian trains. They are more expensive but have a higher quality of service, and consist of modern 1st, 2nd and 3rd class carriages. On board you&rsquo;ll typically find air conditioning, tea and coffee making facilities, a kiosk with souvenirs and simple products, and a restaurant with interior decoration individual to each train. Some cities run their own particular trains and invest a lot of attention into the quality and comfort of the service, often naming the trains after nearby places of geographical interest. For example, a train provided by the city of Perm has been named &lsquo;Kama&rsquo;, after the Kama river which runs through the city. Another famous example is the &lsquo;Rossiya&rsquo; train which transports passengers across the entire length of Russia, from Moscow to Vladivostok. Express To Russia sells train tickets for all branded trains.</p>
<h3>Non-branded trains (нефирменный)</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.travexpress.net/pages/013710.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="900" height="550" caption="false" alt="Train Types in Russia - Non-branded trains" /></p>
<p>These trains provide an efficient, regular, and reliable service, although generally without the first-class luxury of the branded trains. Non-branded trains also provide long-distance services and typically serve more stations, and are a popular mode of transport amongst travellers.</p>
<h2>Train types by speed</h2>
<h3>High-speed train (скоростной, высокоскоростной)</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.travexpress.net/pages/013698.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="900" height="550" caption="false" alt="High-speed trains in Russia" /></p>
<p>High speed trains travel between 90 and 200km/h and are a very efficient way of travelling by rail, although they do not serve the vast majority of Russia&rsquo;s territory. The newest and most popular of Russia&rsquo;s high-speed trains are named after birds: Sapsan (Peregrine Falcon) and Lastochka (Swallow).</p>
<p>Sapsan trains serve the route between St. Petersburg and Moscow. Service is very professional and efficient and trains are modern and comfortable, with reclining seats, a seat buffet service, and free films and TV shows. A journey on the Sapsan can transport you between Russia&rsquo;s capitals in less than four hours, compared to the eight-hour journey on the sleeper train. They are ideal for business people as the Sapsan trains provide wifi, a private conference room and on-train offices.</p>
<p>Lastochka trains serve suburban areas in the vicinity of large cities, and are modern and efficient. They are popular among locals and tourists alike as they are quicker than regular suburban trains.</p>
<h3>Express train (скорый)</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.travexpress.net/pages/013700.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="900" height="550" caption="false" alt="Express trains in Russia" /></p>
<p>Express trains travel at an average of 50 km/h to 91 km/h and comprise the vast majority of Russia&rsquo;s long-distance services. Both branded and non-branded services use express trains, with the difference being the level of service you can expect while travelling.</p>
<h3>Regular train (пассажирский)</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.travexpress.net/pages/013699.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="900" height="550" caption="false" alt="Train Types in Russia" /></p>
<p>These trains travel relatively slowly, at less than 50km/h, and serve every station along their route. If you are a patient person and want the opportunity to properly admire Russia&rsquo;s landscapes, this may be the choice for you! But if you&rsquo;re on a tight schedule, maybe seek another method of transport.</p>
<h2>Train types by distance covered</h2>
<h3>Long-distance trains (дальний)</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.travexpress.net/pages/013702.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="900" height="550" caption="false" alt="Train Types in Russia - Long-distance trains" /></p>
<p>The majority of services offered by Express to Russia are long-distance trains which serve routes of over 200km. Long-distance services can vary greatly by speed travelled and the level of service and comfort offered. Trains serving long-distance routes are sleeper trains and journeys are measured in sutki (24-hour periods).</p>
<h3>Electric suburban train (пригородный)</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.travexpress.net/pages/013703.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="900" height="550" caption="false" alt="Train Types in Russia - Suburban trains" /></p>
<p>Elektrichki are widely popular methods of transport, connecting large cities with their suburbs and rural districts. Older elektrichki are not the most comfortable, with metal or wooden benches and brown/grey interiors, although these trains are often upgraded to provide a higher level of comfort. Regardless, you can enjoy the entertainment provided by buskers passing through the carriages and admire the scenery outside. Travelling by elektrichka will give you the most authentic experience of Russian everyday life. It is a very popular way of travelling to the dacha (summer house) or the countryside or seaside, and when the weather is good these routes are often busy. Tickets can be purchased for a very reasonable price at all Russian train stations, both at self-service machines or at the cash desk.</p>
<h2>Types of compartments</h2>
<h3>VIP (Luxury carriages on sleeper trains)</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.travexpress.net/pages/013704.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="900" height="550" caption="false" alt="VIP cabin on a Russian train" /></p>
<p>VIP carriages contain four, five or six compartments, and those with four boast the luxury of an in-carriage bar! A VIP cabin is double the size of a standard one, and can be locked from the inside. Your room will be equipped with a double bottom-bunk and single upper-bunk, desk, armchair, storage space, adjustable air-conditioning, power sockets, TV/DVD, and Wi-Fi. VIP passengers have the luxury of their own private bathroom with a shower (a rarity on Russian sleeper trains), sink and toilet, and bathrobe and slippers are provided. And it doesn&rsquo;t stop there - the bathroom floor is even heated!</p>
<h3>1st Class (SV - Sleeper Carriage)</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.travexpress.net/pages/013708.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="900" height="550" caption="false" alt="1st class sleeper on a Russian train" /></p>
<p>First class (also known as SV) is the comfortable and exclusive option most commonly available on Russian trains. The cabin is designed to accommodate two people, with two long couches which can be converted into sofa-beds, and a table. On some services, first class compartments can include showers. If you are a solo traveller and really want to travel in style, it&rsquo;s possible to purchase both tickets for the first class cabin.</p>
<h3>2nd Class (kupe - coup&eacute;)</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.travexpress.net/pages/013705.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="900" height="550" caption="false" alt="2nd class sleeper on a Russian train" /></p>
<p>The next option is a 2nd class cabin, or kupe. These compartments accommodate four people, with two lower and two upper bunks and a table. Kupe cabins can be locked from the inside and have luggage storage space above the door. It&rsquo;s worth knowing that some trains offer &lsquo;female only&rsquo; or &lsquo;male only&rsquo; cabins.</p>
<h3>3rd Class (Platzkart - shared open compartment)</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.travexpress.net/pages/013706.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="900" height="550" caption="false" alt="3rd class platzkart in Russia" /></p>
<p>3rd class, or platzkart, is even cheaper. The arrangement is two upper and lower bunks perpendicular to the window, a narrow aisle, and one upper and lower bunk alongside the opposite window. This layout runs the entire way along the carriage, with no doors or curtains. If you are concerned about locking away your luggage and having privacy, platzkart is not for you, but if you&rsquo;re trying to save money and don&rsquo;t mind the lack of privacy or quiet, then it is a convenient option.</p>
<p>For solo women travellers who cannot find a &lsquo;female only&rsquo; kupe and feel uncomfortable sharing a cabin with three strangers, platzkart may be a better option. And for those travelling in southern Russia during summer, platzkart carriages have better ventilation than 2nd class cabins - four people in a small space without air conditioning can be quite stifling. Platzkart is best of all for travellers who want to socialise with Russian people and learn a bit of the language! Please take note that bedding is provided in all classes of sleeper carriage.</p>
<h3>Seats</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.travexpress.net/pages/013707.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="900" height="550" caption="false" alt="Train Types in Russia" /></p>
<p>The cheapest option for travelling by train are simple seated tickets, with seats similar to those found on airplanes. On the Sapsan route between St Petersburg and Moscow, and the &lsquo;Allegro&rsquo; service operating between Russia and Finland, more expensive tickets come with extra leg-room and reclining abilities. When travelling on the Sapsan, tickets booked in advance can even be cheaper than the sleeper train!</p>
<p>As you have seen, there is an enormous variety of options when travelling by train in Russia. You just need to decide what is most important and convenient for you, and enjoy your adventure.</p>

<h2>Which ticket types exist in Russia?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>E-ticket with electronic registration</strong> This is a ticket with electronic registration. The electronic ticket that we email to you does not have to be exchanged prior to your trip. To board the train, you just have to show this electronic ticket and your passport.</li>
<li><strong>E-ticket without electronic registration (semi e-ticket)</strong> This is a ticket which will be sent to you by email, but which you will have to exchange for a boarding pass prior to the trip at the train station. You can exchange your semi e-ticket in a ticket booth (it should have an E-ticket sign) or at an electronic terminal at the train station. To get your boarding pass at the station and to board a train you will have to show your passport.</li>
<li><strong>Paper ticket</strong> Although electronic tickets are available on most destinations, there are certain routes where only paper tickets can be issued. Paper ticket can either be delivered to your address (at an extra charge) or you can pick it up in one of our offices. To board the train you will have to show the ticket and also your passport. It is important to remember that paper ticket can only be used in original, no copies are accepted. Lost or damaged tickets cannot be reissued, so be careful once you receive your paper ticket and keep it in a safe place</li>

<h2>Buying Russian Train Tickets</h2>
<p><img src="https://images.travexpress.net/pages/013729.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="900" height="550" caption="false" alt="Buying train tickets in Russia" /></p>
<p>Buying tickets for <a href="/" title="Russian trains">Russian trains</a> is not such an easy task - even for locals. <strong>Russian rail tickets</strong> can be purchased from ticket offices directly at the train station or through a travel agency. Here are the answers to the most popular questions regarding ticket booking process.</p>
<div id="faqs" class="faqs">
<div class="toggle faq">
<div class="togglet">
  <i class="toggle-closed icon-angle-down"></i>
  <i class="toggle-open icon-angle-right"></i>
  Is it possible to book train tickets in advance?</div>
<div class="togglec">In Russia, it is impossible to reserve train tickets - passengers must always purchase their 
  <a href="/" title="Russian trains">
    Russian train tickets</a> first in order to secure their travel dates. 
    The tickets go on sale 45 days before the actual train departure.</div>
</div>
<div class="toggle faq">
<div class="togglet"><i class="toggle-closed icon-angle-down"></i><i class="toggle-open icon-angle-right"></i>Is it possible to buy a ticket with an open date?</div>
<div class="togglec">There are also no open tickets for <strong>Russian trains</strong> - you will have to buy a ticket for a particular train on a certain date.</div>
</div>
<div class="toggle faq">
<div class="togglet"><i class="toggle-closed icon-angle-down"></i><i class="toggle-open icon-angle-right"></i>Are train tickets for foreigners same price as those for locals?</div>
<div class="togglec">There is no double pricing system for foreigners applied to rail tickets as there frequently is with theater tickets, so tickets are the same price whether you are Russian or not.</div>
</div>
<div class="toggle faq">
<div class="togglet"><i class="toggle-closed icon-angle-down"></i><i class="toggle-open icon-angle-right"></i>When is the best time to buy the tickets?</div>
<div class="togglec">In summer is the peak season for traveling and it's better to organize your journey in advance. This also applies to late spring and early autumn. If you plan on traveling during these periods, it is important to book your tickets in advance, at least a few weeks but even better - over 1 month ahead of your desired departure date. Moreover, if you want to get the cheapest ticket possible then book even earlier, because prices tend to increase, when there is more demand for tickets. In June, for example, it is hard to get tickets in Moscow a week before you desired departure date. Your only option might be the most expensive ticket in the most extravagant VIP train, instead of having options for something more convenient that fit your personal needs and budget.</div>
</div>
<div class="toggle faq">
<div class="togglet"><i class="toggle-closed icon-angle-down"></i><i class="toggle-open icon-angle-right"></i>Which documents are required to buy a train ticket?</div>
<div class="togglec">In order to purchase tickets, you have to present your passport - no other documents are acceptable (except for a Russian military pass or Russian civil servant card). It is usually possible to purchase a ticket by only showing a passport copy or even just giving your passport number to the ticket agent, however you must be aware that documents are checked when boarding the train and there will be trouble if your documents do not match what is written on the ticket.</div>
</div>
<div class="toggle faq">
<div class="togglet"><i class="toggle-closed icon-angle-down"></i><i class="toggle-open icon-angle-right"></i>Which is better &ndash; buying train ticket at the station or from an agency?</div>
<div class="togglec">Getting your <a href="/" title="Russian trains">Russian train ticket</a> is quite easy but there are a few things you should know. First, you have to remember to purchase the tickets in advance, especially to the popular destinations such as Southern Russia, Central Russia and the Trans-Siberian route. You can buy tickets at the railway stations and in special ticket offices as well as from travel agencies and some Internet ticket offices. If you choose a travel agency they will save you some time and make the process of getting the tickets very smooth for you, but at the same time they will charge an extra service fee for every purchased ticket. Usually the fee is not high, but the service is very good - it really beats standing in line at the ticket office for up to 3 hours. In Russia, as was stated before, it is possible to purchase a ticket up to 45 days in advance of your trip but not more than 45 days. On the most traveled destination routes like Moscow to St. Petersburg there are lots of trains, which travel back and forth, so it is always possible to get a ticket even on the same day as your desired departure date, but these tickets will probably be the most expensive options. Getting your ticket might also take some time unless you are willing to pay an extra fee by ordering tickets though a travel company. If not, you have to wait in line for at least a half an hour and have your money prepared, because it is impossible to reserve a spot - you must always actually buy the ticket and refunds are possible but you will lose a substantial part of the fare when you return your ticket.
